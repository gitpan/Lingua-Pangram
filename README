SYNOPSIS
      use Lingua::Pangram;
      my $pan = Lingua::Pangram->new;
      print "is a pangram" if $pan->pangram("a string");

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports no functions. It has an object-oriented
    interface with one method: pangram. This method takes a string and
    returns 1 if the string passed in contains all the letters of the
    alphabet, otherwise it returns 0.
    It is possible to change the notion of what comprises "all the
    letters of the alphabet" by passing in an alternative set to the
    ->new method.

AVAILABILITY
    It should be available for download from
    http://russell.matbouli.org/code/lingua-pangram/ or from CPAN, in
    the directory authors/id/I/ID/IDORU.

TODO
    Perhaps create minpangram which tests whether the string contains
    exactly one of each letter.
